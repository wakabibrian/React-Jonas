# Section 1: Introduction

React Component - Is a piece of the user interface.
A component in React is just a function
Components/the functions return JSX.
In a react, we update a state with useState
useState is a function in react which returns an Array.

# Creating a New React App

To Start: npm run start

# Section 2: JS Review

Learnt;

-   Destructuring - Getting data out of an object or out of an array
-   Rest operator - Creating an array with other items not destructured
-   Spread operator - Selects all items in the arrays/objects and adds a new one at the end
-   Template Literals - Create strings that contain JavaScript variables/any Javascript expression
-   Ternary Operator Instead of if/else Statements
-   Arrow Functions - New way of writing functions
-   Short-Circuiting And Logical Operators: &&, ||, ??
    -   || (or) operator - short-circuits when the first value is true (immediately returns that first value)
    -   && (and) operator - short-circuits when the first value is false (immediately returns that first value)
    -   ?? (nullish coalescing operator) operator - It works very simillary as the || operator (only for null or undefined) but doesnot for 0 or ""
-   Optional Chaining (?.) - ignore the undefined values (ignore the next variables incase what comes before is undefined or not available )
-   Functional Array Methods: map, filter and reduce: return a new array based on the original one
    -   The Array map Method: Loops over an array and return a new array with some operation applied to each elements of the original array
    -   The Array filter Method: Filtering out some elements of the array based on a condition
    -   The Array reduce Method: The goal is to reduce the array to one value
-   The Array sort Method: Used to sort an array
-   Working With Immutable Arrays: Arrays which are not changed or manipulated
-   Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises; fetching/loading data from an external web api
-   Asynchronous JavaScript: Async/Await; fetching/loading data from an external web api
